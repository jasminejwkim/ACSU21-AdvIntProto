          I wanted to depict the ecosystem of the ocean and how trash can kill animals. I wanted to work on this topic because on the news I heard that a lot of plastic waste and 
          single use products such as masks, latex gloves, etc, were being thrown away in to the ocean. This made me upset and so I wanted to depict that through the game.
          Using the UML diagram I identified the properties and methods of each objects. I envisioned that my whale was moving top and bottom on the left screen but I realized
          that it could be more fun if the whale could move around freely. 
          I translated my diagram into code by seeing what properties and methods I needed. It was a very helpful process because I got to get an overview of what elements I needed to include.
          For the future, I would like to make it more interactive my allowing the mouse control the whale and display the score.
