              I wanted to depict the ecosystem of the ocean and how trash can kill animals. I wanted to work on this topic because on the news I heard that a lot of plastic waste and 
            single use products such as masks, latex gloves, etc, were being thrown away in to the ocean.
            Using the UML diagram I identified the properties and methods of each objects. I envisioned that my whale would move up and down on the left screen but I realized
            that it could be more fun if the whale could move around freely. 
            I translated my diagram into code by seeing what properties and methods I needed. I realized that the diagram was very necessary process because I got to get an overview of what elements I needed to include and organize classes.
            To me, the best part was when I unintentionally made my game represent what happens in real life more by making it more difficult to drag the trash out of the ocean. While clicking and dragging the trash out of the ocean, 
            users would add more trash because it isn't easy to select the trash. In real life, it's easier to not create trash in the first place than to clean it up. 
            For the future, I would like to make it more interactive by allowing the mouse control the whale and display the score.

           <h3>Diagram Revision</h3> 
           After the critique I realized, because this project is a game, it needs the whale to have a HealthIndex(). This would allow the users to know
           if the whale is hurt by eating trash or is healthier because of Krill.

                I started to code by using the diagram. I used it to help me make classes and determine how I was going to use it to put it together.
                Some challenges that I experienced was thinking about how Krill and Trash was going to move around on the page and when it was going to appear.
