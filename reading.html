       "Designing interactive systems demands collavoration between designers of many different disciplines"

       In my previous experience, I found that this collaboration is what makes designing interacitve systems fun. Communication between the designers are very important and therefore, the
       willingness to have differnt types of prototypes was crucial in making one of my past projects. The industrial designers would have to show how user's form while using the system, and
       interaction designers had to focus on behaviors on screen. I feel that when these thoughts and collaboration worked well, the project becomes successful. 

       "What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact"
        
       I think that this is a very important point. Sometimes we get so caught up in making the the prototypes we forget exactly what the purpose of the artifact is and what we want we are trying to
        explore based on that purpose. The proìƒˆtype can be anything as long as it represents the the purpose.

        "While team members learn to interpret abstract kinds of prototypes accurately, less expert audiences cannot normally be expecteed to understand such approximate represenation"
        This made me realize that We have to consider who the prototypes are for. Because I never really had a chance to create prototypes that are for less expert audiences, I never really 
        thought about this point. Exploring what types of prototypes are suitable for different types of audiences would be helpful for me.
