      <h2>
        Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill, What do Prototypes Prototype?" 
      </h2>
      <br>
      <br>
       "Designing interactive systems demands collaboration between designers of many different disciplines"
      <br>
      <br>
       In my previous experience, I found that this collaboration is what makes designing interacitve systems fun. Communication between the designers are very important and therefore, the
       willingness to have differnt types of prototypes was crucial in making one of my past projects. The industrial designers would have to show how user's form while using the system, and
       interaction designers had to focus on behaviors on screen. I feel that when these thoughts and collaboration worked well, the project becomes successful. 
      <br>
      <br>
       "What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact"
       <br> 
       <br>
       I think that this is a very important point. Sometimes we get so caught up in making the the prototypes we forget exactly what the purpose of the artifact is and what we want we are trying to
        explore based on that purpose. The pro새type can be anything as long as it represents the the purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        "While team members learn to interpret abstract kinds of prototypes accurately, less expert audiences cannot normally be expecteed to understand such approximate represenation"
        <br>
        <br>
        This made me realize that We have to consider who the prototypes are for. Because I never really had a chance to create prototypes that are for less expert audiences, I never really 
        thought about this point. Exploring what types of prototypes are suitable for different types of audiences would be helpful for me.

        <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2> 
        <br>
        “Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs.”
        <br>
        <br>
        I agree with this statement because the more I code, the more I start to understand that there is always a system to it. It was a bit hard to understand it at first, but now I understand the need for having variables that can always be plugged in and changed. You definitely need to take things apart and take it step by step. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. One of the problems is that different sets of potential specifications cannot easily be envisioned all at once. Another is that a computer has to be told absolutely everything. However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it."
        <br>
        <br>
        I can relate to this statement because sketching somethings up to communicate the idea is quick and  easy to do but when we code we have to think about all the different variables and think about what needs to be drawn and what is needed to draw that thing. We need to make a diagram to organize our thoughts
        <br>
        <br>
        “The design process is one of trial and error, and it often takes many iterations to create a design that clearly communicates what you're trying to say. Although we tend to think of this process as something involving gut instinct, experienced designers have an ever-expanding checklist of visual relationships that helps guide them through to the final result.”
        <br>
        <br>
        I took a Graphic Design class last term and I relate to this concept of making many iterations to create a design and having a process to reach that goal. The professor would always say, “trust the process” and it consists of constantly sketching out the ideas and keep changing the it.
